Peterson's solution is a classic algorithm in concurrent programming that ensures mutual exclusion, progress, bounded wait, and architecture neutrality. It involves two shared variables: `turn`, which indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section, and `flag[]`, which indicates the intent of each process to enter the critical section.

### Full C Code to Demonstrate Peterson's Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define NUM_ITERATIONS 3  // Number of times each process enters the critical section

int turn;  // Variable to indicate whose turn it is
bool flag[2];  // Array to indicate the intent of each process

void* process(void* arg) {
    int id = *(int*)arg;
    int other = 1 - id;  // ID of the other process

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; i++) {
        // Entry Section
        flag[id] = true;
        turn = other;

        // Wait until it's this process's turn or the other process is not interested
        while (turn == other && flag[other]);

        // Critical Section
        printf("Process %d is in the critical section (Iteration %d)\n", id, i+1);
        sleep(1);  // Simulate work in the critical section

        // Exit Section
        flag[id] = false;
        printf("Process %d is leaving the critical section (Iteration %d)\n", id, i+1);

        // Remainder Section
        sleep(1);  // Simulate work outside the critical section
    }

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    int id1 = 0, id2 = 1;

    // Initialize the flag array
    flag[0] = false;
    flag[1] = false;

    // Creating two threads
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, process, &id1);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, process, &id2);

    // Joining threads
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Mutual Exclusion**: Peterson's solution ensures that only one process enters the critical section at a time by using the `flag[]` and `turn` variables.
- **Progress**: If one process does not wish to enter the critical section, the other process can enter without delay.
- **Bounded Wait**: A process will not be indefinitely postponed; it will enter the critical section after a bounded number of steps.
- **Architecture Neutrality**: Peterson's solution does not rely on specific hardware instructions, making it architecture-neutral.

### Code Flow

1. **Entry Section**: 
    - Each process sets its flag to `true`, indicating its intention to enter the critical section.
    - The process then sets the `turn` to the other process, being "generous" and giving the other process a chance to enter if it also wants to.
    - The process then waits in a loop if it is not its turn and if the other process is also interested (`flag[other]` is `true`).
  
2. **Critical Section**:
    - The process executes its critical section when it passes the entry section checks.

3. **Exit Section**:
    - The process resets its `flag` to `false`, indicating it has exited the critical section.

### Demonstration

When the code runs, you will see that the two processes alternately enter the critical section. This alternation is controlled by the `turn` and `flag[]` variables, ensuring that all four requirements (mutual exclusion, progress, bounded wait, and architecture neutrality) are satisfied.

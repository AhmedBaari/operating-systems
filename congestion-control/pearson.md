Pearson's solution, similar to Dekker's or Peterson's solution, ensures mutual exclusion by using a combination of the `FLAG` array and a `TURN` variable. This solution is more "generous" because each process allows the other process to enter its critical section if both want to enter at the same time, ensuring that all four conditions (mutual exclusion, progress, bounded wait, and architecture neutrality) are satisfied.

### Full C Code Demonstrating Pearson's Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0

int flag[2] = {FALSE, FALSE};  // FLAG array to indicate desire to enter the critical section
int turn = 0;  // TURN variable to indicate whose turn it is

void* process(void* arg) {
    int id = *(int*)arg;
    int other = 1 - id;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  // Each process tries to enter critical section 3 times
        // Entry Section
        flag[id] = TRUE;
        turn = other;

        while (turn == other && flag[other] == TRUE);  // Busy-wait if it's the other process's turn and it wants to enter

        // Critical Section
        printf("Process %d is in the critical section\n", id);
        sleep(1);  // Simulate some work in the critical section

        // Exit Section
        flag[id] = FALSE;
        printf("Process %d is leaving the critical section\n", id);

        // Remainder Section
        sleep(1);  // Simulate some work outside the critical section
    }

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    int id1 = 0, id2 = 1;

    // Creating two threads
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, process, &id1);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, process, &id2);

    // Joining threads
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **FLAG Array**: `flag[0]` and `flag[1]` indicate whether `P0` and `P1` want to enter the critical section, respectively.
- **TURN Variable**: The `turn` variable indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section. This prevents deadlock by giving the other process a chance to proceed.
- **Mutual Exclusion**: The combination of `flag` and `turn` ensures that only one process can enter the critical section at a time.
- **Progress**: If a process is not interested in entering the critical section, the other process can proceed.
- **Bounded Wait**: Even if both processes want to enter the critical section, the `turn` variable ensures that each process will eventually get its turn.
- **Architecture Neutrality**: Pearson's solution does not rely on special hardware instructions, making it architecture-neutral.

### Demonstration

When you run the code, the two processes (`P0` and `P1`) will alternately enter and exit the critical section. The `flag` array and `turn` variable effectively prevent both processes from entering the critical section simultaneously, thereby satisfying mutual exclusion, progress, bounded wait, and architecture neutrality.
